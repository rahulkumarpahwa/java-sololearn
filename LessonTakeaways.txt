Lesson 1 :

Lesson Takeaways

Awesome! You completed your first lesson 🚀. Remember the following important points:

💡 You can write code that generates outputs with the System.out.println() statement

💡 The println instruction needs to be followed by parentheses.

Lesson 2:

Lesson Takeaways

Great work 🎯! You completed the lesson. You learned that:

💡 You can add multiple statements to your programs

💡 Text needs to be enclosed in quotes

💡 Java is a case-sensitive language.

In the next lesson, you’ll learn about the structure of programs in Java.

Lesson 3:

Lesson Takeaways

Great job 🎯! You now know how to create a valid Java program structure!

Remember the following important points:

💡 You need to start your program by creating a class.

💡 The class needs to include a main method, which is the starting point of the program.

💡 The main method includes the statements that need to be executed when the program runs.

💡 The class, as well as the main method opens and closes using opening and closing curly brackets.

Lesson Takeaways 

Awesome! Here are some key takeaways:

 - A variable has a name and a type of the value it holds.

 - To declare a variable use the type followed by the name of the variable.

 - You can assign a value to the declared variable using the = operator.

 - A variable can change its value during the program, by being assigned to a new value.

Lesson 7 :
Lesson Takeaways  

Great job! Here are some key takeaways:

 - int holds integers (whole numbers).

 - double holds decimal numbers.

 - float is similar to double, but has less precision and requires less memory.

 - You need to use an f postfix after the value to make it a float (for example: 3.14f)

 - char holds a single character.

 - boolean can have one of the following values: true or false.

Lesson Takeaways

Math is fun! Here are some key takeaways:

You can use basic math operators to perform calculations with values and variables.

+ is addition

- is subtraction

/ is division

% finds the remainder of a division.

You can add Strings using the + operator, in a process called concatenation.

Lesson 11 :

Lesson Takeaways  

Now you know how to add comments to your code! Here are some key takeaways:

Comments are explanatory statements that explain what the code is doing.

They can contain notes, todos as well as code that is work-in-progress.

// starts a single line comment.

/* */ is used for multi-line comments.

Lesson 1: 
Lesson Takeaways 

That's how you take input from the user in Java!

Here are the steps:

1. import the java.util.Scanner class.

2. create a Scanner object:
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

3. Use the corresponding method of the Scanner to take input, for example:
import java.util.Scanner;

class Demo {
    public static void main(String[ ] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(num);        
    }
}

Lesson Takeaways

Now you know how to make decisions in your code! Here are some key takeaways:

You can check for a condition using the if statement.

In case the condition is false, the code in an else statement can be executed.

Here is a generic structure of if-else statements:

if(condition) {
  //some code
} else if(condition) {
//some other code
} else {
  //some other code
}
