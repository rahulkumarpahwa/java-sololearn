Lesson 1 :

Lesson Takeaways

Awesome! You completed your first lesson ðŸš€. Remember the following important points:

ðŸ’¡ You can write code that generates outputs with the System.out.println() statement

ðŸ’¡ The println instruction needs to be followed by parentheses.

Lesson 2:

Lesson Takeaways

Great work ðŸŽ¯! You completed the lesson. You learned that:

ðŸ’¡ You can add multiple statements to your programs

ðŸ’¡ Text needs to be enclosed in quotes

ðŸ’¡ Java is a case-sensitive language.

In the next lesson, youâ€™ll learn about the structure of programs in Java.

Lesson 3:

Lesson Takeaways

Great job ðŸŽ¯! You now know how to create a valid Java program structure!

Remember the following important points:

ðŸ’¡ You need to start your program by creating a class.

ðŸ’¡ The class needs to include a main method, which is the starting point of the program.

ðŸ’¡ The main method includes the statements that need to be executed when the program runs.

ðŸ’¡ The class, as well as the main method opens and closes using opening and closing curly brackets.

Lesson Takeaways 

Awesome! Here are some key takeaways:

 - A variable has a name and a type of the value it holds.

 - To declare a variable use the type followed by the name of the variable.

 - You can assign a value to the declared variable using the = operator.

 - A variable can change its value during the program, by being assigned to a new value.

Lesson Takeaways  

Great job! Here are some key takeaways:

 - int holds integers (whole numbers).

 - double holds decimal numbers.

 - float is similar to double, but has less precision and requires less memory.

 - You need to use an f postfix after the value to make it a float (for example: 3.14f)

 - char holds a single character.

 - boolean can have one of the following values: true or false.

Lesson Takeaways

Math is fun! Here are some key takeaways:

You can use basic math operators to perform calculations with values and variables.

+ is addition

- is subtraction

/ is division

% finds the remainder of a division.

You can add Strings using the + operator, in a process called concatenation.
